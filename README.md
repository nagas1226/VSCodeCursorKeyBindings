# VSCode Cursor Key Bindings

## Overview
This repository is intended for sharing the `keybindings.json` file, which is the keybinding settings file for Visual Studio Code (VSCode). By using this configuration file, you can streamline cursor movement and edit your code efficiently without having to move your hands away from the home position.

## Setup
Follow these steps to apply the keybinding configuration correctly to your VSCode:

1. Open VSCode.

2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the command palette.

3. Type "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)" and select it from the list. This will open the `keybindings.json` file.

4. Copy the contents of the `keybindings.json` file from this repository and paste them into the opened `keybindings.json` file in VSCode.

5. Save the changes by pressing `Ctrl + S`.

By following these steps, you will correctly configure the cursor keybindings in VSCode.

## Usage
This keybinding configuration provides shortcut keys for cursor movement from the home position (J, K, L, I, H, ;, U, O keys). Below are the main shortcut keys and their descriptions:
